# Hi, I'm Remas 👋

I am passionate about **understanding data and the stories it tells**.  
Just like reading a book, I enjoy exploring datasets to see the patterns, the problems, and the opportunities hidden inside.  

I work with **SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI** to clean data, analyze it, and create dashboards that make the results easy to understand.  
For me, data analysis is about turning numbers into insights that people can actually use.
